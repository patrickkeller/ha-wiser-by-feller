# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Wiser by Feller Home Assistant integration.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- A running Home Assistant instance or dev container (see `.devcontainer/`)

### Set up a development environment

The recommended way to develop is via the included dev container, which runs Home Assistant in a Docker container alongside a Python workspace for linting and testing.

Open the repository in VS Code and select **Reopen in Container** when prompted (requires the Dev Containers extension). VS Code attaches to the Python devcontainer; Home Assistant starts automatically as a separate container and is accessible at `http://localhost:8123`.

**Viewing logs:** From the integrated terminal, run:

```bash
docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml logs -f homeassistant
```

**Debugger:** The `debugpy` integration is pre-configured in `config/configuration.yaml` and starts automatically on port 5678. To attach, use the **Attach to Home Assistant** configuration in the VS Code Run & Debug panel.

**Rebuilding the HA image:** The HA container image has the integration's pip requirements baked in (from `manifest.json`). If you change the `requirements` field in `manifest.json`, rebuild the image before restarting:

```bash
docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml build homeassistant
```

For a local setup without the dev container:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Syonix/ha-wiser-by-feller.git
cd ha-wiser-by-feller
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
./scripts/setup.sh
```

## Working with the aioWiserByFeller library

The integration depends on [aioWiserByFeller](https://github.com/Syonix/aioWiserByFeller). If you are making changes to both repos simultaneously, use the following workflow to avoid publishing a new library version just to test integration changes.

### Development (editable local library)

Bump the library version in its `pyproject.toml` to a dev suffix:

```toml
version = "2.0.1.dev0"
```

Update the requirement in `manifest.json` to match:

```json
"aiowiserbyfeller==2.0.1.dev0"
```

Install the library into this repo's venv in editable mode:

```bash
make dev
```

This makes the editable library available to the test suite immediately. For the running HA container, rebuild the image after bumping the version in `manifest.json` (see above); HA will then install the new version from PyPI on startup.

### Switching to the published version

Before opening a PR, verify the integration works with the published library:

```bash
make prod
```

This installs the exact version currently pinned in `manifest.json`. Revert any temporary `manifest.json` changes to the published version pin first.

### Commit discipline

Keep `pyproject.toml` at `X.Y.Z.dev0` and `manifest.json` at `X.Y.Z.dev0` on the working branch. The `.dev0` suffix signals that the library has unpublished changes; remove it from both files once the library is published and before running release-it.

## Testing

### Dependencies

The test suite uses [`pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`](https://github.com/MatthewFlamm/pytest-homeassistant-custom-component), which provides the same test infrastructure that Home Assistant core uses — including the `hass` fixture, `MockConfigEntry`, and the custom-integration loader. All test dependencies are in `requirements.test.txt`; `./scripts/setup.sh` installs them automatically.

### Running the tests

```bash
# Run everything
pytest

# Run a single module
pytest tests/test_coordinator.py -v

# Run a specific test
pytest tests/test_light.py::test_dim_brightness_conversion -v

# Run with coverage (terminal summary)
pytest --cov=custom_components/wiser_by_feller --cov-report=term-missing

# Run with HTML coverage report
pytest --cov=custom_components/wiser_by_feller --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html
```

### Test structure

| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `tests/conftest.py` | Shared fixtures: `hass`, `mock_config_entry`, `mock_coordinator`, `mock_gateway`, `setup_integration` |
| `tests/test_init.py` | Integration setup/teardown, gateway device registration, service registration |
| `tests/test_coordinator.py` | `WiserCoordinator`: error handling, lazy loading, unknown-type issue creation, WebSocket state updates |
| `tests/test_util.py` | Pure utility functions: brightness/cover/tilt conversion, colour helpers, device name resolution |
| `tests/test_light.py` | Light platform: OnOff, Dim, DimTW, DimRGBW entities |
| `tests/test_cover.py` | Cover platform: relay, positional, venetian blind (tilt) entities |
| `tests/test_climate.py` | Climate platform: HVAC group entities, mode/action/temperature handling |
| `tests/test_sensor.py` | Sensor platform: gateway health sensors, device sensors, binary rain/hail sensors |
| `tests/test_switch.py` | Switch platform: system flag entities |
| `tests/test_button.py` | Button platform: ping, impulse, and climate-ping entities |
| `tests/test_scene.py` | Scene platform: scene entities, job filtering |
| `tests/test_diagnostics.py` | Diagnostic output, redaction of serial numbers and tokens |
| `tests/test_config_flow.py` | Config flow: discovery, user step, re-auth |
| `tests/test_websocket.py` | `GatewayWebsocket`: reconnect backoff, dead-connection detection, per-message error handling, restart/close lifecycle |
| `tests/test_gateway_auth.py` | `SerializedAuth`: one request at a time, per-request timeout |

### Shared fixtures

`conftest.py` provides these fixtures for all test files:

- **`hass`** — a real (in-process) Home Assistant instance, provided by `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`
- **`mock_config_entry`** — a `MockConfigEntry` pre-configured for the `wiser_by_feller` domain
- **`mock_gateway`** — a `MagicMock` representing the µGateway device with realistic string attributes
- **`mock_coordinator`** — a `MagicMock(spec=WiserCoordinator)` with all data stores pre-populated as empty dicts/lists; tests override individual stores as needed
- **`gateway_patches`** — patches `SerializedAuth`, `WiserByFellerAPI` and `WiserCoordinator` so a config entry sets up with `mock_coordinator`
- **`setup_integration`** — calls `hass.config_entries.async_setup(...)` with the mocked coordinator and returns the loaded config entry

For unit tests that don't need a full HA stack (e.g. entity property tests), instantiate entity classes directly — it's faster and simpler.

### Writing new tests

- Use `MagicMock(spec=<ApiClass>)` for load/device/sensor objects; set only the attributes your test exercises.
- Always set `load.name` to a plain string — `resolve_device_name()` reads it and the HA device registry will reject a `MagicMock` value during teardown.
- For full-stack platform tests (those that call `hass.config_entries.async_setup`), use the `mock_config_entry` and `mock_coordinator` fixtures together with `gateway_patches` (e.g. `@pytest.mark.usefixtures("gateway_patches")`), which patches `SerializedAuth`, `WiserByFellerAPI`, and `WiserCoordinator` in `custom_components.wiser_by_feller`. The `setup_integration` fixture does all of this and sets up the entry.

## Before committing

Run ruff to format and lint the code — the CI pipeline enforces both checks and will block your PR if they fail:

```bash
./scripts/lint.sh
```

This runs `ruff format` followed by `ruff check --fix` on the entire project. Make sure there are no remaining lint errors before pushing.

To check without auto-fixing:

```bash
ruff format --check --diff custom_components
ruff check custom_components
```

## Submitting changes

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes in `custom_components/wiser_by_feller/`.
3. Run `./scripts/lint.sh` and resolve any issues.
4. Run the test suite: `pytest`
5. Open a pull request against `main` with a clear description of what changed and why.

If your PR implements a new platform or device type, please also update the relevant section in `README.md`.

## Reporting bugs and requesting features

Use the GitHub issue templates:

- **Bug report** — for reproducible problems. Include your HA version, integration version, and µGateway generation.
- **Feature request** — for new functionality or device support.

## Code style

- All code must pass `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` (configured in `pyproject.toml`).
- Keep entity logic in the appropriate platform file (`light.py`, `cover.py`, etc.).
- Shared utilities belong in `util.py` or `entity.py`.
- Do not add comments that just describe what the code does — only add them when the *why* is non-obvious.
